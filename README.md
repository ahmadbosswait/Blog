## This is a perfect Bespoke CMS for a personal blog
 
This is my first experience in MVC programming framework so I tried to follow all standards as mush as I can, however, there are some functions could be better optimized.

It is free to use and I really appreicate if anyone can contribute to this project.

### Technologies I used:
PIP framework (Light type of Code Igniter)
Php 5.6
MySql 5.6
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
Bootstrap 3.3.7
jQuery
